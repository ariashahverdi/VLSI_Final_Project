# VLSI_Final_Project

To make to code :

* Go to Debug folder type:
1) make clean
2) make

To run the program when you are in “Debug” folder Type:
./VLSI_Final_Project ../data/input.txt

The input file of the program should be in “data” folder and the output of the program will also be there.

Note: If you got an error which says the program got killed that’s probably a issue with glue. I tried my code on compute.ece.umd.edu and it never get killed automatically.

The script for plotting the floor-plan is in the data folder.
